# Advanced Java Projects: GUI, JSP & Database Integration

This repository contains a curated collection of Java projects demonstrating advanced concepts in **GUI development using Swing**, **web development with JSP**, and **database integration using JDBC**. These projects serve as practical examples of building both desktop and web-based Java applications.

---

## Project Overview

### GUI Development (Swing)
- Utilizes `JFrame`, `JPanel`, `JButton`, `JTextField`, `JLabel`, and other Swing components.
- Event handling using interfaces like `ActionListener`, `MouseListener`, and custom listeners.
- Demonstrates layout management and modular GUI design.

### Web Development (JSP)
- User authentication, session management, and dynamic content rendering using JSP.
- Frontend and backend integration using HTML forms, JSP scriptlets, and JDBC.
- Basic email and messaging interfaces built with JSP and JDBC logic.

### Database Integration
- JDBC-based interaction with MS Access and MySQL/SQLite databases.
- Demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Use of `PreparedStatement` for secure and optimized queries.
- Transaction management and exception handling.

### Advanced Java Concepts
- Multithreading in GUI-based desktop applications.
- MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture in GUI and JSP modules.
- Robust error handling and logging.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK 6)**
- **Apache Tomcat 7** (for JSP-based web applications)
- **MS Access** or **MySQL/SQLite** (for database operations)
- **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse IDE**
- **JDBC-ODBC bridge driver** or **UCanAccess** (for MS Access integration)

### Running the Applications

#### For Desktop GUI Projects:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ).
3. Ensure JDK 6 is selected as the project SDK.
4. Run the Java class containing the `main` method.

#### For JSP Web Projects:
1. Install and configure **Apache Tomcat 7**.
2. Deploy the project under the `webapps` directory.
3. Configure database access in `WEB-INF/web.xml` or a `*.properties` file.
4. Start the Tomcat server and access the project via `http://localhost:8080/YourAppName`.
